# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
   #Not required
   #State.create([{ name: 'North Carolina', state_code: "NC" }, { name: 'Alabama', state_code: 'AL' }])
#   State.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
